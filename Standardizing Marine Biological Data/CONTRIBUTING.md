## Contribute writiing, research, examples or ideas

Contribute directly to chapters (01-Intro.Rmd. Either through the GitHub website and direct edits to the R markdown files prefixed with chapter numbers (eg. 01-intro.Rmd). You can write both markdown or R, and even python code. I build all the chapters into the book using bookdown and the technologies wraped by that.

If you are a member of the IOOS GitHub org you can edit the file on GitHub, or through a pull request if you're a collaborator.
