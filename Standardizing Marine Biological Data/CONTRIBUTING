# Contribute to the guide


## Contribute writiing, research, examples or ideas

Contribute directly to chapters (01-Intro.Rmd. Either through the GitHub website and direct edits to the R markdown files prefixed with chapter numbers (eg. 01-intro.Rmd). You can write both markdown or R, and even python code. I build all the chapters into the book using bookdown and the technologies wraped by that.

If you are a member of the IOOS GitHub org you can edit the files directly on GitHub, or through a fork and then pull-request if you're an external  collaborator.

## Building the book

To build the book: 

* Make sure you have the most recent version of R and R Studio
* Start a new project in R Studio using version control
* Fork or clone the github repository from this urL: https://github.com/ioos/bio_data_guide.git
* Install all the requried packages: specifically `bookdown` and others as required
* In the Build tab, click 'Build Book' or in the console run `rmarkdown::render_site(encoding = 'UTF-8')`
* Commit and push chagnes to all modified files using the git pane in R Studio
