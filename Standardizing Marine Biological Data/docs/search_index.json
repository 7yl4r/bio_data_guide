This is about stacking the right standards for your desired interoperability with other data types. For example, interoperating fish biology measurements with climate level variables. There are a few links neccessary to make this possible and will permit broader access to better ecosystem based models. This phenomena is not unique to specic scientific domains, but is rather pervasive as many scientific domains are currently being reshaped in light of recent advances in computing power, technology, and data science. 1.1 Data Structures The OBIS-ENV Darwin Core Archive Data Structure. OBIS manual 1.2 Ontologies &amp; Controlled Vocabularies An ontology is a classification system for establishing a hierarchically related set of concepts. Concepts are often terms from controlled vocabularies. From Marine Metadata: # TODO: add link &quot;Ontologies can include all of the following, but are not required to include them, depending on which perspective from above you adhere to: Classes (general things, types of things) Instances (individual things) Relationships among things Properties of things Functions, processes, constraints, and rules relating to things&quot; TODO: Research Unified Modeling Language? There are a number of controlled vocabularies that are used to describe parameters commonly used in specific research domains. This allows for greater interoperability of data sets within the domain, and ideally between domains. Here, we strive to document a number of relevant examples. Climate and Format (CF) Standard Names are applied to sensors for application with OPeNDAP web service. Device categories using the SeaDataNet device categories in NERC 2.0 Device make/model using the SeaVoX Device Catalogue in NERC 2.0, Platform categories using SeaVoX Platform Categories in NERC 2.0 Platform instances using the ICES Platform Codes in NERC 2.0 Unit of measure GCMD Keywords (NASA) Geographic Domain/Features of Interest GeoLink base ontology was part of the EarthCube GeoLink Project TODO: Improve this paragraph There are numberous ways to investigate which controlled vocabulary to use and this can be fairly overwhelming. For a simplified overview see here. Note: To describe a measurement or fact of a biological specimen that conforms to Darwin Core standards, it’s neccessary to use the ‘Biological entity described elsewhere’ method rather than taxon specific. 1.2.1 Collections 1.2.2 Oceanography Biological and Chemcial Oceanography Data Management Office Marine metadata interoperability vocab resources 1.2.3 Biology BioPortal Ecosystem Ontology 1.2.4 NERC Search Interfaces SeaDatanet Common Vocab Search Interface: SeaDataNet Common Vocabularies: SeaDataNet Vocab Library 1.2.5 Geosciences UDUNITSare more common unit measurements in geosciences 1.2.6 Eco/EnvO Environment Ontology including genomics. 1.2.7 Wild Cards Question: Not sure use case for this. P01 Biological Entity Parameter Code Builder 1.3 Technologies 1.3.1 ERDDAP ERDDAP can be thought of as a data server. It provides ‘easier access to scientific data’ by providing a consistent interface that aggregates many disparate data sources. It does this by providing translation services between many common file types for gridded arrarys (‘net CDF’ files) and tabular data (spreadsheets). Data access is also made easier because it unifies different types of data servers and access protocols. Here is a basic erddap installation that walks you through how to load a data set. 1.4 Notes on Integrating OBIS, Darwin Core as it relates to OOS’s 1.5 Metadata OBIS uses the GBIF EML profile (version 1.1). In case data providers use ISO19115/ISO19139, there is a mapping available here: http://rs.gbif.org/schema/eml-gbif-profile/1.1/eml2iso19139.xsl This will be important for integrating OBIS datasets to OOS metadata profiles. 1.6 Data QC There are a number of tools available to check the quality of data or check your data format against the expected standard. OBIS Datatools shows some great R packages for this. 1.6.1 Compliance Checking LifeWatch Belgium provides a number of tools to check your data against. Specifically you can test OBIS data format and see a map of your sample locations to check if they are on land.

In a concerted effort to adopt or establish how best to do that, several Hakai and CIOOS staff attended an International Ocean Observing System (IOOS) Code Sprint in Ann Arbour, Michigan between October 7–11, 2019, to discuss how to implement FAIR data principles for biological data collected in the marine environment. The Darwin Core is a highly structured data format that standardizes data table relations, vocabularies, and defines field names. The Darwin Core defines three table types: event, occurrence, and measurementOrFact. This intuitively captures the way most ecologists conduct their research. Typically, a survey (event) is conducted and measurements, counts, or observations (collectively measurementOrFacts) are made regarding a specific habitat or species (occurrence). In the following script I demonstrate how I go about converting a subset of the data collected from the Hakai Institute Juvenile Salmon Program and discuss challenges, solutions, pros and cons, and when and what’s worthwhile to convert to Darwin Core. The conversion of a dataset to Darwin Core is much easier if your data are already tidy (normalized) in which you represent your data in separate tables that reflect the hierarchical and related nature of your observations. If your data are not already in a consistent and structured format, the conversion would likely be very arduous and not intuitive. 3.1.1 event The first step is to consider what you will define as an event in your data set. I defined the capture of fish using a purse seine net as the event. Therefore, each row in the event table is one deployment of a seine net and is assigned a unique eventID. My process for conversion was to make a new table called event and map the standard Darwin Core column names to pre-existing columns that serve the same purpose in my original seine_data table and populate the other required fields. event &lt;- tibble(eventID = survey_seines$seine_id, eventDate = date(survey_seines$survey_date), decimalLatitude = survey_seines$lat, decimalLongitude = survey_seines$long, geodeticDatum = &quot;EPSG:4326 WGS84&quot;, minimumDepthInMeters = 0, maximumDepthInMeters = 9, # seine depth is 9 m samplingProtocol = &quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.21966/1.566666&quot; # This is the DOI for the Hakai Salmon Data Package that contains the smnpling protocol, as well as the complete data package ) write_csv(event, here::here(&quot;datasets&quot;, &quot;hakai_salmon_data&quot;, &quot;event.csv&quot;)) 3.1.2 occurrence Next you’ll want to determine what constitutes an occurrence for your data set. Because each event captures fish, I consider each fish to be an occurrence. Therefore, the unit of observation (each row) in the occurrence table is a fish. To link each occurrence to an event you need to include the eventID column for every occurrence so that you know what seine (event) each fish (occurrence) came from. You must also provide a globally unique identifier for each occurrence. I already have a locally unique identifier for each fish in the original fish_data table called ufn. To make it globally unique I pre-pend the organization and research program metadata to the ufn column. #TODO: Include bycatch data as well ## make table long first seines_total_long &lt;- survey_seines %&gt;% select(seine_id, so_total, pi_total, cu_total, co_total, he_total, ck_total) %&gt;% pivot_longer(-seine_id, names_to = &quot;scientificName&quot;, values_to = &quot;n&quot;) seines_total_long$scientificName &lt;- recode(seines_total_long$scientificName, so_total = &quot;Oncorhynchus nerka&quot;, pi_total = &quot;Oncorhynchus gorbushca&quot;, cu_total = &quot;Oncorhynchus keta&quot;, co_total = &quot;Oncorhynchus kisutch&quot;, ck_total = &quot;Oncorhynchus tshawytscha&quot;, he_total = &quot;Clupea pallasii&quot;) seines_taken_long &lt;- survey_seines %&gt;% select(seine_id, so_taken, pi_taken, cu_taken, co_taken, he_taken, ck_taken) %&gt;% pivot_longer(-seine_id, names_to = &quot;scientificName&quot;, values_to = &quot;n_taken&quot;) seines_taken_long$scientificName &lt;- recode(seines_taken_long$scientificName, so_taken = &quot;Oncorhynchus nerka&quot;, pi_taken = &quot;Oncorhynchus gorbushca&quot;, cu_taken = &quot;Oncorhynchus keta&quot;, co_taken = &quot;Oncorhynchus kisutch&quot;, ck_taken = &quot;Oncorhynchus tshawytscha&quot;, he_taken = &quot;Clupea pallasii&quot;) ## remove records that have already been assigned an ID seines_long &lt;- full_join(seines_total_long, seines_taken_long, by = c(&quot;seine_id&quot;, &quot;scientificName&quot;)) %&gt;% drop_na() %&gt;% mutate(n_not_taken = n - n_taken) %&gt;% #so_total includes the number taken so I subtract n_taken to get n_not_taken select(-n_taken, -n) %&gt;% filter(n_not_taken &gt; 0) all_fish_caught &lt;- seines_long[rep(seq.int(1, nrow(seines_long)), seines_long$n_not_taken), 1:3] %&gt;% select(-n_not_taken) %&gt;% mutate(prefix = &quot;hakai-jsp-&quot;, suffix = 1:nrow(.), occurrenceID = paste0(prefix, suffix) ) %&gt;% select(-prefix, -suffix) # # Change species names to full Scientific names latin &lt;- fct_recode(fish_data$species, &quot;Oncorhynchus nerka&quot; = &quot;SO&quot;, &quot;Oncorhynchus gorbuscha&quot; = &quot;PI&quot;, &quot;Oncorhynchus keta&quot; = &quot;CU&quot;, &quot;Oncorhynchus kisutch&quot; = &quot;CO&quot;, &quot;Clupea pallasii&quot; = &quot;HE&quot;, &quot;Oncorhynchus tshawytscha&quot; = &quot;CK&quot;) %&gt;% as.character() fish_retained_data &lt;- fish_data %&gt;% mutate(scientificName = latin) %&gt;% select(-species) %&gt;% mutate(prefix = &quot;hakai-jsp-&quot;, occurrenceID = paste0(prefix, ufn)) %&gt;% select(-semsp_id, -prefix, -ufn, -fork_length_field, -fork_length, -weight, -weight_field) occurrence &lt;- bind_rows(all_fish_caught, fish_retained_data) %&gt;% mutate(basisOfRecord = &quot;HumanObservation&quot;, occurenceStatus = &quot;present&quot;) %&gt;% rename(eventID = seine_id) For each occurrence of the six different fish species that I caught I need to match the species name that I provide with the official scientificName that is part of the World Register of Marine Species database http://www.marinespecies.org/ # I went directly to the WoRMS webite (http://www.marinespecies.org/) to download the full taxonomic levels for the salmon species I have and put the WoRMS output (species_matched.xls) table in this project directory which is read in below and joined with the occurrence table species_matched &lt;- readxl::read_excel(here::here(&quot;datasets&quot;, &quot;hakai_salmon_data&quot;, &quot;raw_data&quot;, &quot;species_matched.xls&quot;)) occurrence &lt;- left_join(occurrence, species_matched, by = c(&quot;scientificName&quot; = &quot;ScientificName&quot;)) %&gt;% select(occurrenceID, basisOfRecord, scientificName, eventID, occurrenceStatus = occurenceStatus, Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species) write_csv(occurrence, here::here(&quot;datasets&quot;, &quot;hakai_salmon_data&quot;, &quot;occurrence.csv&quot;)) 3.1.3 measurementOrFact To convert all your measurements or facts from your normal format to Darwin Core you essentially need to put all your measurements into one column called measurementType and a corresponding column called measurementValue. This standardizes the column names are in the measurementOrFact table. There are a number of predefined measurementTypes listed on the NERC database that should be used where possible. I found it difficult to navigate this page to find the correct measurementType. Here I convert length, and weight measurements that relate to an event and an occurrence and call those measurementTypes as length and weight. fish_data$weight &lt;- coalesce(fish_data$weight, fish_data$weight_field) fish_data$fork_length &lt;- coalesce(fish_data$fork_length, fish_data$fork_length_field) fish_length &lt;- fish_data %&gt;% mutate(occurrenceID = paste0(&quot;hakai-jsp-&quot;, ufn)) %&gt;% select(occurrenceID, eventID = seine_id, fork_length, weight) %&gt;% mutate(measurementType = &quot;fork length&quot;, measurementValue = fork_length) %&gt;% select(eventID, occurrenceID, measurementType, measurementValue) %&gt;% mutate(measurementUnit = &quot;millimetres&quot;, measurementUnitID = &quot;http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/P06/current/UXMM/&quot;) fish_weight &lt;- fish_data %&gt;% mutate(occurrenceID = paste0(&quot;hakai-jsp-&quot;, ufn)) %&gt;% select(occurrenceID, eventID = seine_id, fork_length, weight) %&gt;% mutate(measurementType = &quot;mass&quot;, measurementValue = weight) %&gt;% select(eventID, occurrenceID, measurementType, measurementValue) %&gt;% mutate(measurementUnit = &quot;grams&quot;, measurementUnitID = &quot;http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/P06/current/UGRM/&quot;) measurementOrFact &lt;- bind_rows(fish_length, fish_weight) %&gt;% drop_na(measurementValue) rm(fish_length, fish_weight) write_csv(measurementOrFact, here::here(&quot;datasets&quot;, &quot;hakai_salmon_data&quot;, &quot;measurementOrFact.csv&quot;)) rm() 3.1.4 Combine into DwC-A DwCA &lt;- left_join(occurrence, event) %&gt;% mutate(scientificNameID = 126140) %&gt;% drop_na(eventDate) # loses 1388 rows.
