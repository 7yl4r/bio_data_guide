Hello and welcome to the Darwin Core Guide! Here, we document relevant resources and standards 
which apply to various marine biological data types. This is a growing guide that is put together by scientists and 
data managers responsible for transforming their data to meet international standards.

This guide is meant for  data managers, scientists, or technicians new to transforming/publishing/mobilizing data. 
There is a general introduction to the world of international data integration, followed by some specific examples of 
data transformations.
