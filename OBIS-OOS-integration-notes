# Notes on Integrating OBIS, Darwin Core as it relates to OOS's

## Metadata

OBIS uses the [GBIF EML profile](http://rs.gbif.org/schema/eml-gbif-profile/1.1/eml-gbif-profile.xsd) (version 1.1). In case data providers use ISO19115/ISO19139, there is a mapping available here: http://rs.gbif.org/schema/eml-gbif-profile/1.1/eml2iso19139.xsl This will be important for integrating OBIS datasets to OOS metadata profiles.

## Data QC

There are a number of tools available to check the quality of data or check your data format against the expected standard.

### Compliance Checking 

LifeWatch Belgium provides a number of tools to check your data against.
Specifically you can test OBIS data format and see a map of your sample locations to check if they are on land.
