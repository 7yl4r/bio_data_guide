Jeniece Germain is working on a dataset at the 2022 BioData Mobilization Workshop.

The data contains fish occurrences observed living on certain corals or sponges.

It is suggested that the corals, fishes, and sponges be uploaded as occurrences.
Then fish should include a `associatedOccurrence` linking them to their "home" coral/sponge.
The coral/sponges could similiarly be linked to the occurrences of the fish living on them.

One date has multiple corals/sponges and the same corals & sponges are recorded over time.
