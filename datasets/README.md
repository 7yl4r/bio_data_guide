This directory contains datasets we are working on and ones we have kept to use as examples.
Of special interest are the subdirectories named `example_*`.

Each subdirectory here should have a README file which will give further information about the data, documentation, and code that might be included in the dataset's directory.

Each folder in this directory can get built into a chapter of the "Darwin Core Guide" book. For info on how to make that work see `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
