This is an example dataset demonstrating the absolute minimum needed to put data into OBIS.
There is only an occurence file with rows of taxa occurrences and only the bare minimum columns.

This data is fabricated for demonstration purposes only; these are not real occurrences.

You *can* submit your data like this, but Darwin Core can do so much more.
