# Bio Data Guide
:notebook: This repository contains living documentation to help those just getting started with biological data or those looking to learn and contribute to IOOS's best practices for biological data.

## :question: Have Questions? :question:
* See the "issues" tab above to ask questions or discuss with the IOOS biodata community.
* Also try searching for related issues which are open or have been closed (ie answered)

## Got Data?
* :speech_balloon: open an issue in the issues tab above
* :floppy_disk: small datasets can be uploaded into `./datasets/` and we can help you align with best practices
* :link: dataset repositories or other hosted data can be included in the links in the `Datasets` section below

# Datasets
The `./datasets/` directory in this repository contains small datasets which meet one of the following criteria:
* :construction_worker: the community is currently aligning this data
* :notebook: the dataset is retained as an instructive example
* :speak_no_evil: the lazy maintainers of this repo haven't cleaned it out yet 

Ideally each dataset should contain a README.md file with details about the data and the ingestion process for this dataset.
A few datasets are highlighted below as especially instructive examples:

* [example_script_with_fake_data](https://github.com/ioos/bio_data_guide/tree/master/datasets/example_script_with_fake_data) - fake data crafted by Abby Benson to illustrate a very basic conversion to DwC

## Linked datasets
Datasets not included in this directory but still meeting one of the criteria above are linked here:

* [FL MBON Zooplankton](https://github.com/USF-IMARS/zoo-taxonomy-to-darwin-core)

# Historical

This repo has grown out of the 2019 IOOS code sprint.
Original documents from the sprint are retained on a fork of this repo in [marinebon/bio_data_scripts_ioos_workshop_2019](https://github.com/marinebon/bio_data_scripts_ioos_workshop_2019).
