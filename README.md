# Bio Data Guide
:notebook: This repository contains living documentation to help those just getting started with biological data or those looking to learn and contribute to IOOS's best practices for biological data.

## :question: Have Questions? :question:
* See the "issues" tab above to ask questions or discuss with the IOOS biodata community.
* Also try searching for related issues which are open or have been closed (ie answered)

## Got Data?
