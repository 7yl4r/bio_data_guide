# Controlled Vocabularies

There are a number of controlled vocabularies that are used to describe parameters commonly used in a research domain. This allows for greater interoperability of data sets. There are numberous ways to investigate which controlled vocabulary to use and this can be fairly overwhelming. For a simplified overview see:

To describe a measurement or fact of a biological specimen that conforms to Darwin Core standards, it's neccessary to use the 'Biological entity described elsewhere' method rather than taxon specific.
