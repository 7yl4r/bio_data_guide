# Notes on Integrating OBIS, Darwin Core as it relates to OOS's

## Metadata

OBIS uses the [GBIF EML profile](http://rs.gbif.org/schema/eml-gbif-profile/1.1/eml-gbif-profile.xsd) (version 1.1). In case data providers use ISO19115/ISO19139, there is a mapping available here: http://rs.gbif.org/schema/eml-gbif-profile/1.1/eml2iso19139.xsl This will be important for integrating OBIS datasets to OOS metadata profiles.

## Controlled Vocabularies

There are a number of controlled vocabularies that are used to describe parameters commonly used. This allows for greater interoperability of data sets. There are numberous ways to investigate which controlled vocabulary to use and this can be fairly overwhelming. For a simplified overview see:

http://seadatanet.maris2.nl/v_bodc_vocab_v2/vocab_relations.asp?lib=P08

To describe a measurement or fact of a biological specimen that conforms to Darwin Core standards, it's neccessary to use the 'Biological entity described elsewhere' method rather than taxon specific.


### Measurement Units 
See P06 vocab:

## Data QC

There are a number of tools available to check the quality of data or check your data format against the expected standard.

### Compliance Checking 

LifeWatch Belgium provides a number of tools to check your data against.
Specifically you can test OBIS data format and see a map of your sample locations to check if they are on land.
