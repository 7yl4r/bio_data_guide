TODO: 
* Discuss diff between controlled vocabs and ontologies
* Break out controlled vocabs by research domain or some logical grouping

There are a number of controlled vocabularies that are used to describe parameters commonly used in a research domain. This allows for greater interoperability of data sets. There are numberous ways to investigate which controlled vocabulary to use and this can be fairly overwhelming. For a simplified overview see:

http://seadatanet.maris2.nl/v_bodc_vocab_v2/vocab_relations.asp?lib=P08

To describe a measurement or fact of a biological specimen that conforms to Darwin Core standards, it's neccessary to use the 'Biological entity described elsewhere' method rather than taxon specific.
